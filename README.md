## Food Desert and Its Affect on Health and Education

### Introduction:

Food deserts are geographic areas where residents face significant barriers to accessing affordable and nutritious food. These barriers are often due to the absence of nearby grocery stores, supermarkets, or farmers' markets offering fresh and healthy options. Instead, communities in food deserts tend to rely on convenience stores or fast-food outlets, which predominantly provide processed, calorie-dense, and nutritionally poor foods.

### Objective:

This data science project, conducted in R, aims to answer the critical question:
How do food deserts, characterized by low access to nutritious food, correlate with obesity rates and educational attainment across U.S. states?

### Data Sources:

- **Food Desert Data**: Provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) based on the 2010 census tract, encompassing 72,864 observations across 147 variables.
- **Education Data**: Collected from U.S. Census data, containing 1,540 variables across 52 geographical areas.
- **Obesity Data**: Sourced from data.gov, published by Lake County, Illinois, covering obesity percentages for 52 states.

### Findings:

Through our analysis using linear regression models, we identified significant correlations between food deserts, obesity rates, and educational attainment:

- **Obesity Rates**: States with a higher prevalence of food deserts exhibited increased obesity levels. This aligns with our hypothesis that areas with low access to nutritious food rely more on fast-food outlets and calorie-dense foods, contributing to higher obesity rates.
- **Educational Attainment**: Higher levels of food deserts within a state were associated with lower educational attainment. This finding supports our prediction that areas with limited healthy food access are often underdeveloped, leading to fewer opportunities for educational advancement.

### Conclusion:

Our findings underscore the complex and intertwined relationships between food availability, public health, and education. Addressing food deserts through policy interventions and community development may improve both health outcomes and educational opportunities in affected regions.
